# Searchable Employee Directory API

## Created a searchable API using the Fetch API and a random user generator. Generated: 
- User images,
- Employee names,
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Address
- DOB's.

## Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Fetch API
- JSON

Used the fetch API to import all user data and used json to parse the data. Used JavaScript asynchronous call back functions, Arrays, loops, conditionals and object iteration.
Impemented a JavaScript list search filter froma an example from the w3schools website that lets you filter and search the directory basxed on name and by creating an overlay and modal window that has detailed information about the employee, which is browasable by clicking the Arrow buttons.
